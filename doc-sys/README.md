## About this project

This project focus on implementing decentralised way of providing user to store there markdown documents that can be later used for project or personal need. The web3 projects mostly done on open source code and requirements/bounty of project features are initiated via repository using markdown files. Project try to cater to this niche of users.

## How it's Made

This Project uses web3.storage from IPFS team to store data to decentralised storage. It creates CID for all file stored that can be easily retrieved. Allow user full control of his data and no collection privacy details. One of the challenges was immutable files, which can be overcome by creating a new file on updating of file previosuly saved, not the perfect experience for user but given the limitation of current api provided by web3.storage.

### Built With

- React JS
- Web3.storage from IPFS
